        <p>
            Hello dear viwer! My name is Guy, I'm 28 years old, living in Israel Ashdod and studying managment and database systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            I love going to the gym because it makes me feel in control of my body, animals, nature and I have two cats called Max and Lucy :)
        </p>
        <p>
            I love spending time outdoors because it helps me ground myself and keep me worry free.
        </p>
        <p>
            my passions are trainging at the gym focusing on muscle hypetrophy, Rowing, airsoft, gamimg and learning new things.

        <p>
            I'v served in the military in the Daburim unit in Ashdod.
        </p>
        <p>
            My service consisted of going out to sea and protecting the borders between Israel and the Gaza strip.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'v served as the cheif engineer of a Dvora Mk 3 and was resposible for maintaning the ships' mechanical capacity along with commanding over 4 mechanics.
        </p>

        <p>
            As difficult as my service was I felt a strong sense of purpose.
        </p>

        <p>
            I believe I fit in the QA world because I love pointing out problems and finding bugs in code.
        </p>
        <p>
            By the end of the course I see myself at a good stable job working in the high tech industry.
        <p>
            I hope that by the end of this course I will be able to pick point the exact topic inside the industry that I am most passionate about.
